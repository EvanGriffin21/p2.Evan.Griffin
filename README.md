For a C
Starting with my weather widget I will have todays weather, how it feels outside and I have added something that will tell me what I should be wearing for example a Hoodie and pants.
For my clock widget I will have todays current time followed by todays date.
I then grouped up my calander with my events of the day with my messaging, news feed and social feed becuase I feel like those are all sources of information that I will be viewing at around the same time.
Then from the left again I have my light button that will act as a light source upon being pressed.
Then I have my sleep widget which will have the amount of time that I have slept form the previous night with the amount of light and deep sleep below, then I will have my weekly average of sleep with its light and deep sleep average below.
I will then have my weight widget whcih will display my current weight, last weeks average weight and my goal weight which is personal to me because I do bodybuilding so Im either trying to gain weight or lose weight to a certain degree so I like to look at my progress through those numbers. 
Lastly I have my activity widget which will have charts for my steps , standing time and amount of excercise clocked in per day according to my phone along wioth the current amount of steps, standing time and excerise for the current day.
