## For a C
Starting with my weather widget I will have todays weather, how it feels outside and I have added something that will tell me what I should be wearing for example a Hoodie and pants.
For my clock widget I will have todays current time followed by todays date.
I then grouped up my calander with my events of the day with my messaging, news feed and social feed becuase I feel like those are all sources of information that I will be viewing at around the same time.
Then from the left again I have my light button that will act as a light source upon being pressed.
Then I have my sleep widget which will have the amount of time that I have slept form the previous night with the amount of light and deep sleep below, then I will have my weekly average of sleep with its light and deep sleep average below.
I will then have my weight widget whcih will display my current weight, last weeks average weight and my goal weight which is personal to me because I do bodybuilding so Im either trying to gain weight or lose weight to a certain degree so I like to look at my progress through those numbers. 
Lastly I have my activity widget which will have charts for my steps , standing time and amount of excercise clocked in per day according to my phone along wioth the current amount of steps, standing time and excerise for the current day.

## For a B
Here in my final implementation in processing my mirror works first of all by incorperating my webcam to show myself. From there I have my different widgets. Starting from the top I have my weather widget which utilizies data from the json file that I used which I got from api.openweathermap.org. Then I have the current time and date which I got from the built in functions hour(), minute(), day(), month(), and year();. Then for my message and other feed I used a csv file that I created and grabbed data from there. Next I have my light button that will change the tint of the webcam when pressed. Then I have my calander which will display all of my days events such as class and work if I have it that day which is data drawn from my csv aswell. Then lastlty I have my current weight, last weeks average weight and my goal weight which is also from my csv file.
